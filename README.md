# Multi-Model-AI-Assistant
Utilize the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini at the same time.

This tool makes call to OpenAI's API and Gemini's API simultanously and presents the results side-by-side. So now you can get the responses from both the models and pick the best one of the two.

It also maintains the context history (it remembers the previous messages in a chat). This allows getting intelligent answers based on the flow of the conversation.
